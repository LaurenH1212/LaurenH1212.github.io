      <p>Welcome to my site! This is my digital portfolio for DIGIT 100. This site contains my resume, portfolio, and all the digital projects for my DIGIT 100 class!</p>
      <p><em>Note: This site is a work in progress so please be patient!</em>

    <h2> Some information about me: </h2>
      <p>I am a mechanical engineering major at Penn State Berks in my fourth year and will graduate next school year. I am currently freelancing at a craft company where I work</p>
      <p>part time and do crafts for money! It is something I do on the side because school is my main focus and takes up most of my time. In the free time I have, I can be found</p>
      <p>reading, drawing, listening to music or hanging around with my friends. I enjoy going out with the friends I have from high school and those I have made in my days of </p>
      <p>college as well! I read mostly horror and thriller books and also love those types of movies and shows as well. I listen to all types of music and lean towards surrealistic</p>
      <p>art which can be seen in my Portfolio. I hope to learn a lot about coding and AI in DIGIT 100 as I code a lot in MATLAB for my other classes but it is mostly math based.</p>
