    <h2>At the moment I do not have much <em>digital</em> work to share here as part of my portfolio but I do have plenty of artwork that can be seen below</h2>

    <h2>Hobby Art</h2>
    <p><img src="./images/Jake.jpg" alt="Jake and Alyssa"> <img src="./images/Heart.jpg" alt="Heart in hand"></p>
    <p><img src="./images/Spider.jpg" alt="Spider in eye"> <img src="./images/Eagle.jpg" alt="Exeter Eagle"></p>
    <p><img src="./images/Eye.jpg" alt="Domino Eye"> <img src="./images/Philly.jpg" alt="Philly Eagle"></p>
    <p><img src="./images/Spiderman.jpg" alt="Pride Spiderman"></p>
    <h3>All of these images were done by me by hand with different mediums such as chalk, paint, pencil or marker. They range in age as some are very recent and some are older and show a great reange of my abilities.</h3>

    <h2>Digital Work</h2>
    <p><img src="./images/Shaft.JPG" alt="Shaft Project"></p>
    <h3>This image is a shaft that I made in SolidWorks this semester as part of a project for my shaft design class, ME 357. I created the entire thing from scratch including the measurements and design for where the gears and keys will go which you can see in the grooves.</h3>

    <h2>DIGIT 100</h2>
    <p><img src="./images/Data.jpg" alt="Dear Data"> <img src="./images/Data_1.jpg" alt="Dear Data"></p>
    <h3>This is a project done in my DIGIT 100 class where I mapped the music I listened to for a week. It has an image of the data along with a legend containing the information. The legend explains how to read the genre of music, activity done while lsitening, and the image shows the length of the period.</h3>
