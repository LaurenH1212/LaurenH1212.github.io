    <h2>5 Novels By Charlotte Perkins Gilman</h2>
    <p>For this project I analyzed five novels by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. For the first part of the project, the text encoding and markup, I looked at “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and marked it with Pulsar. I mainly looked at the structure, clarity, and meaning of the text to get a better understanding of what happens in the story and get a larger picture of the text as a whole. The second part of the project required looking at all five texts through Voyant which is a text analysis tool/website. This was done through looking at key words throughout the texts, as well as other tools to look at the texts as a whole.</p>
    <p>The first thing I did with “The Yellow Wallpaper” was mark up the structure of the text. Gilman uses mainly a paragraph style structure, with some paragraphs being one or two sentences long and some even consisting of only dialog. I also marked where the “frontmatter” was such as the title and author although Gilman does not include any other notes or contributions of any kind. I then read through the entire text in depth to get an understanding of what is happening in the story. “The Yellow Wallpaper” is about a woman (the narrator) suffering from post-partum depression which her husband misdiagnoses as a nervous disorder. The novel documents her descent into madness as everyone around her refuses to believe in her illness and the wallpaper taunts her senses. As I read, I marked any words I needed any clarity on, or I thought the general reader would not understand on the first read through. The novel was originally published in 1892, so the language was quite different than what we are used to today. I also kept track of the narrator’s emotions throughout the story as that is a main part of the climax and plot of the text as well. For example, in the beginning of the story the narrator speaks about her husband and his doubts about her illness " <code>&lt;emotion name="anger"&gt; You see, he does not believe I am sick!&lt;/emotion&gt; </code>." I then went through the text and documented where the narrator spoke about the wallpaper; things like the appearance, the patterns, the smell, and later the figures she sees and the woman she sees behind the wallpaper. For example, towards the end of the text she talks about the woman trapped inside of the wallpaper "<code>&lt;wallpaper type="pattern" name="woman"&gt; I didn’t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind,—that dim sub-pattern,—but now I am quite sure it is a woman.&lt;/wallpaper&gt;</code>." This gives a better sense of what she is feeling as well, her motivation for her actions at the end of the story and her thought process as the story progresses. Through the process of marking up this text, I learned a lot about the novel and what Gilman wanted to portray in this story. The dangers of misogyny and carelessness with your loved one are key themes in this story with how the husband, John, treats the narrator and constantly undermines her and her illness.</p>
    <p>For the second part of this project, I looked at all five novels through Voyant tools to get an understanding for all of them as a bigger picture. The five works I looked at were “The Yellow Wallpaper”, “Herland”, “What Diantha Did”, “Moving the Mountain”, and “The Crux”, all by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Voyant uses many different tools to analyze the text specifically and gives output based on the words in the story. For example, this is a word cloud uploaded from Voyant for “The Yellow Wallpaper” that shows the most common words used in the novel based on their size. It can be seen the most common words are “John”, “pattern”, “said”, “don’t”, and “room” which all match the description of the novel.<p>

    <p>These words are used consistently throughout the novel, with words like pattern and wallpaper being used more towards the end as the topic of the wallpaper reaches it’s high and the novel comes to it’s peak. When looking at the other novels in the corpus, it’s clear that Gilman has a particular style of writing and wording choice that she sticks with throughout her work. A lot of the main words in the corpus as a whole are words like “said”, character names, “women”, “Mrs.”, “people” and things along those lines. Keeping in mind these are all novels with plots and storylines, this makes sense as they all contain characters with names, dialog, interaction, and thoughts as well. Additionally, Gilman was known for advocating for women’s rights and economic freedom and was a vocal advocate for women’s equality. All of her stories in the corpus are about feminism and women’s freedom in some way or another.</p>
    <p>Though I only looked at one of the texts through the text encoding and markups, I think I learned a lot about the writing style of Gilman and the style in general of the 1800’s. The text encoding took a lot more time and effort than looking at the texts through Voyant but overall taught me more about what the narrator was going through and her thoughts and emotions throughout the story. On the other hand, Voyant was a quicker way to learn more about all of the texts in my corpus and could tell me things at a glance that I would have to hunt down through text encoding. However, it doesn’t have much in-depth information like the analysis of emotions or characters. I think with a combination of both of them, a very good analysis of the novels could be conducted based on the surface level information from Voyant (i.e. the word analysis and vocabulary) and the in-depth information gathered through text encoding (i.e. analysis of the characters and storyline). As I only did the text encoding part for “The Yellow Wallpaper”, I can only speak on that novel, but I learned more about the writing style of Gilman than anything else through this process.</p>
