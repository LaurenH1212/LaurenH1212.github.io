    <h1 class="down">Elizabot AI Project</h1>
    <p>The Elizabot (linked to in the header) started as a therapist AI bot, and I quite liked the idea of the computer who couldn't feel anything dealing with peoples' problems all the time. To create something similar I turned Eliza into a psychic/ clairvoyant who could speak with spirits and the unknowns of the world to help people with their problems. I leaned into the creepiness that came with the AI bot not giving perfect answers 100% of the time often mixing things up and giving really vague answers as psychics often do. Things like “I sense this is causing you distress” or “The answer is not clear yet, go on” were helpful in getting the user to continue using the bot without giving them a real answer. These are tricks psychics use to trick people in the real world as well to get money or fame. Overall, the idea of a psychic computer seemed very contradictory and interesting to me as it reads like somewhat of an oxymoron with the collision of the all knowing technology and the unknown of the subconscious and death.</p>
